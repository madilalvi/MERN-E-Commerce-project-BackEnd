# MERN-E-Commerce-project-BackEnd
This repository is dedicated to the backend component of my MERN project. It will contain all of the crucial code and files required to manage and operate the server-side functionality of the project. This will includes database management, server-side logic, and API endpoints that allow for communication between the frontend and the backend.
